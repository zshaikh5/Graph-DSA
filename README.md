# Graph-DSA
This project implements a graph data structure in C++ with various functionalities. It includes core graph operations like depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithms using both Kruskal's and Prim's methods. The project demonstrates key concepts in graph theory and algorithm design.
